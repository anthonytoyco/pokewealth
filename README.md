# PokeWealth

**Snap your card. Track your value.**

A simple web app to upload Pokémon card images and get instant AI-powered price estimates using Gemini 2.0 Flash.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. (in the google doc)Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with your Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

5. Run the FastAPI server:
```bash
fastapi dev
```

Backend will be running at `http://localhost:8000`


### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the pokewealth folder:
```bash
cd pokewealth
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

DONE (image uploading and analyzing should work now)
