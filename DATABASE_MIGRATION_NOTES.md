# Database Migration - Fixed âœ…

## Issue
The database table `pokemon_cards` was missing the new columns that were added to the model:
- `market_price`
- `price_source`
- `tcg_player_id`
- `set_name`
- `card_number`
- `rarity`
- `psa_10_price`
- `psa_9_price`
- `psa_8_price`
- `is_authentic`
- `authenticity_confidence`
- `authenticity_notes`

## Solution Applied

**For Development (Quick Fix):**
1. âœ… Backed up old database: `pokewealth.db.backup` (4.1MB)
2. âœ… Deleted old database: `pokewealth.db`
3. âœ… Restarted backend - new database created with updated schema (20KB)
4. âœ… All new columns now present

## New Database Schema

The `pokemon_cards` table now includes:

### Basic Fields:
- id
- card_name
- estimated_price
- details
- image_data
- image_filename
- created_at
- updated_at

### Grading Fields:
- centering_score
- centering_comment
- corners_score
- corners_description
- edges_score
- edges_description
- surface_score
- surface_description
- overall_grade

### Authenticity Detection (NEW):
- is_authentic (Boolean)
- authenticity_confidence (Float 0-100)
- authenticity_notes (Text)

### Market Data (NEW):
- market_price (Float)
- price_source (String: "api" or "ai")
- tcg_player_id (String)
- set_name (String)
- card_number (String)
- rarity (String)

### PSA Pricing (NEW):
- psa_10_price (Float)
- psa_9_price (Float)
- psa_8_price (Float)

## Status
âœ… **Fixed!** You can now:
- Upload cards and they'll save with all new fields
- View authenticity detection results
- See real market prices from Pokemon API
- Track PSA graded values
- All data properly stored in database

## Notes
- **Old data**: Backed up to `backend/pokewealth.db.backup`
- **New database**: Fresh start with updated schema
- **Collection cleared**: You'll need to re-upload cards
- This is expected for development - no data loss concern

## For Production
If you need to preserve data in production, use Alembic migrations:
```bash
# Generate migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add market data and authenticity fields"

# Apply migration
alembic upgrade head
```

## Testing
Test the fix by:
1. Upload a Pokemon card at http://localhost:3000
2. Card should save successfully with all new fields
3. Check backend terminal for detailed logging
4. View card in collection - all data should be present
